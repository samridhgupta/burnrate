# MESSAGES
# ============================================================================

THEME_MSG_EXCELLENT="Look at this. An efficient session. Go ahead, take a bow. You earned it. 🎤"
THEME_MSG_GOOD="Decent numbers. Not exceptional, but the crowd isn't leaving. That counts. 👏"
THEME_MSG_WARNING="Cache rate's slipping. The material isn't landing like it used to. 😬"
THEME_MSG_CRITICAL="This is the part of the show where people quietly check their phones. 🪦"
THEME_MSG_DANGER="You bombed. Not a little. Completely. The room is empty. They're refunding tickets. 🍅"

THEME_CACHE_MSG_EXCELLENT="Cache knows the material cold — not one wasted cycle of fresh compute. Great prep. 🎤"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_GOOD="Cache doing its job. You're not reinventing the wheel every prompt. Good instinct. 👏"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_POOR="No cache, no prep, just winging it and hoping nobody notices. They noticed. The bill noticed. 🍅"

THEME_BUDGET_MSG_OK="Budget's fine. You're not spending like you're trying to lose it. Refreshing. 🎤"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_WARNING="Spend rate is... ambitious. Let's call it ambitious. 😬"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_CRITICAL="Budget's almost gone. In the comedy world, we call this a 'tight five' with no material left. 🪦"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_EXCEEDED="Budget: deceased. Cause of death: low cache rate and high ambition. Next of kin has been notified. 🍅"

THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_DAILY="🎙️ Unlimited daily — either very brave or not paying attention. Either way, good material. (burnrate config)"
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_MONTHLY="💸 Unlimited monthly — you've written yourself an open bar tab at a very expensive bar."
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_BOTH="🍅 No limits at all — bold move. Let's see how this plays out. It won't play out well. (burnrate config)"

THEME_FOOTER="The numbers don't lie. Unfortunately, neither does this tool."

# Context window messages
THEME_CTX_OK="Context window has room. You haven't run out of material yet. 🎤"
THEME_CTX_HALF="Context at half capacity. The second act is looming — consider /compact before intermission. 😬"
THEME_CTX_WARNING="Context filling fast. The venue's getting crowded. /compact before someone calls the fire marshal. 🪦"
THEME_CTX_CRITICAL="Context is full. This show is over. /compact or start a new engagement. The audience has left. 🍅"

# ============================================================================
# TIPS
# ============================================================================

THEME_TIP_1="💡 Cache hit = free material. You already paid for the joke. Use it again."
THEME_TIP_2="💡 High cache rate means the audience heard this bit before. That's good here."
THEME_TIP_3="💡 Short tight sets cost less than rambling improv sessions. Shocking, I know."
THEME_TIP_4="💡 Output tokens cost 5x input. Asking for shorter answers isn't rude, it's smart."
THEME_TIP_5="💡 /compact = cutting the dead weight before the second set. Do it."
THEME_TIP_6="💡 A budget is just knowing when to leave the stage. Know when to leave the stage."
THEME_TIP_7="💡 The best performer in this room is your cache. It works for free. 🎤"
