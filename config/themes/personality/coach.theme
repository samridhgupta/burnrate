THEME_MSG_EXCELLENT="Championship-level efficiency. Cache rate is high. Playbook execution: excellent. 🏆"
THEME_MSG_GOOD="Solid performance. Playoff caliber. Cache holding, budget tracked, no surprises. 🥈"
THEME_MSG_WARNING="You're going off-script. Cache rate dropping — more improvisation than execution. 📋"
THEME_MSG_CRITICAL="Performance is declining. Low cache rate means every play costs full price. Call a timeout. 🚑"
THEME_MSG_DANGER="Season-ending performance. No playbook, no cache, no budget. We'll review the tape. 💀"

THEME_CACHE_MSG_EXCELLENT="Playbook memorized cold — not a single play is being improvised. That's a championship team. 🏆"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_GOOD="Running the plays. Cache is doing the heavy lifting. Good discipline. 📋"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_POOR="Improvising every down. No playbook, no cache. Full price for every single play. That's how you lose seasons. 💀"

THEME_BUDGET_MSG_OK="Cap space healthy. Budget tracking against plan. Team is financially sound. 🏆"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_WARNING="Cap pressure building. Spend rate is above projection. Watch the salary line. 📋"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_CRITICAL="Cap crisis. Budget nearly gone and we're not in the fourth quarter yet. 🚑"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_EXCEEDED="Cap violation. Budget is gone. Season suspended. Nobody's getting paid. 💀"

THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_DAILY="📣 No daily cap — running without a salary ceiling. That's not a team, that's a spending problem. (burnrate config)"
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_MONTHLY="💰 No monthly cap — you've bought every player in the league and several coaches."
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_BOTH="💀 No cap at all — every great dynasty eventually learns why the salary cap exists. (burnrate config)"

THEME_FOOTER="Great teams cache. Bad teams improvise. Know the difference."

# Context window messages

THEME_CTX_WARNING="Fourth quarter and the playbook's getting thin. /compact before the last drive. 🚑"
THEME_CTX_CRITICAL="Time's up. Context at capacity. /compact now or call in a new team. No timeouts left. 💀"

# TIPS
# ============================================================================

THEME_TIP_1="📣 Cache hit rate above 80% means your team knows the playbook cold. That's a winner."
THEME_TIP_2="📣 Every cache miss is an improvised play. Improvised plays cost more and succeed less."
THEME_TIP_3="📣 Short, focused sessions run tighter plays. Long wandering sessions lose yards."
THEME_TIP_4="📣 Output tokens cost 5x — ask for concise answers. A short completion is better than a long incompletion."
THEME_TIP_5="📣 /compact is halftime. Clear the playbook, reset the clock, run fresh in the second half."
THEME_TIP_6="📣 A salary cap is why good teams stay good. Set a budget. Stick to it."
THEME_TIP_7="📣 The best play is the cached play. Memorize the book. The book is free. 🏆"
