# MESSAGES
# ============================================================================

THEME_MSG_EXCELLENT="Forge at working temperature. Iron pre-heated. Cache doing its job. Strike while it's hot. ⚒️"
THEME_MSG_GOOD="Good heat. Steady strike. Cache keeping the metal warm between runs. 🔨"
THEME_MSG_WARNING="Coal burning faster than the work warrants. Cache rate dropping — cold starts incoming. 🔥"
THEME_MSG_CRITICAL="Forge overheating without the pre-heat. Every stroke costs a full coal load. 💥"
THEME_MSG_DANGER="The forge is cold. The coal is gone. The iron never got to temperature. Start over. ☠️"

THEME_CACHE_MSG_EXCELLENT="Pre-heat holding — cache is keeping the metal hot between passes. Not a shovel of coal wasted. ⚒️"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_GOOD="Iron's warm from the last run. Cache working. Less coal per piece. 🔨"
THEME_CACHE_MSG_POOR="Cold starts on everything. Full coal load every time. Cache isn't holding heat. This is the expensive way to forge. ❄️"

THEME_BUDGET_MSG_OK="Coal allocation in line with the work. Forge running clean. ⚒️"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_WARNING="Coal burning faster than the order requires. Watch the pile. 🔥"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_CRITICAL="Last shovels in the bin. Budget nearly gone. The work isn't finished. 💥"
THEME_BUDGET_MSG_EXCEEDED="No coal. Forge is cold. Order's not filled. Budget's dead. Go home and think about caching. ☠️"

THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_DAILY="🪨 Unlimited daily — coal like it grows on trees. It doesn't. (burnrate config)"
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_MONTHLY="⛏️ Unlimited monthly — you've claimed the whole mine as your budget. Bold."
THEME_BUDGET_UNLIMITED_BOTH="☠️  No limits set — running the forge with the doors open in winter. (burnrate config)"

THEME_FOOTER="The forge runs hot and expensive. Cache is the pre-heat. Use it."

# Context window messages
THEME_CTX_OK="Plenty of room in the working area. Forge floor clear — work can continue. ⚒️"
THEME_CTX_HALF="Forge floor getting crowded. Run /compact before the next big piece. 🔥"
THEME_CTX_WARNING="Working area nearly full! /compact before something gets knocked over. 💥"
THEME_CTX_CRITICAL="Forge floor at capacity! /compact immediately or start a fresh session in a clean forge. ☠️"

# TIPS
# ============================================================================

THEME_TIP_1="🔧 Cache = pre-heat. Work metal that's already hot. Free. Every time."
THEME_TIP_2="🔧 High cache rate means less coal per finished piece. That's the whole game."
THEME_TIP_3="🔧 Short, focused runs keep the heat up. Scattered sessions lose it."
THEME_TIP_4="🔧 Output tokens cost 5x — every extra word in the response is coal you didn't need to burn."
THEME_TIP_5="🔧 /compact is clearing the forge floor between runs. Costs nothing, gains everything."
THEME_TIP_6="🔧 Know your coal budget. A forge without limits runs until the mine's empty."
THEME_TIP_7="🔧 A master smith wastes nothing. Cache is the pre-heat. The pre-heat is free. ⚒️"
